# *** docs from iterm2 prefs => profile => advanced tab => semantic history ***
# In this mode semantic history will only be activated when you click on an existing file name.
# You can provide substitutions as follows:
#   \1 will be replaced with the filename.
#   \2 will be replaced with the line number.
#   \3 will be replaced with the text before the click.
#   \4 will be replaced with the text after the click.
#   \5 will be replaced with the working directory.
#
# This is also an interpolated string evaluated in the context of the current session. In addition to the usual variables, the following substitutions are available:
#   \(semanticHistory.path) will be replaced with the filename.
#   \(semanticHistory.lineNumber) will be replaced with the line number.
#   \(semanticHistory.columnNumber) will be replaced with the column number.
#   \(semanticHistory.prefix) will be replaced with the text before the click.
#   \(semanticHistory.suffix) will be replaced with the text after the click.
#   \(semanticHistory.workingDirectory) will be replaced with the working directory.
# *** end docs ***
#
# *** FYI I used this value in iterm2 semantic history text box:
#   set drop down to "Run command"
#      TODO try "Always run command" which can work with text that is not an existing file => i.e. parse text for things like github "org/repo" in output, and open in browser at github.com?
#   $HOME/repos/github/g0t4/dotfiles/iterm2/semantic-click-handler/advanced.fish \1 "\2" "unused" "unused" \5
#       \1,\5 => iTerm escapes "\ " the paths, so I don't need "", AND if I add "" then logic below sees them as "\ " not " " and then fails (ie test if directory)
#           PRN if I have further issues with escaping, I should look in iTerm2 source/docs for how it interpolates...
#       \2 => leave "\2" because if there is no line number then the blank means the args shift left (\3 => \2, \4 => \3, etc)
#       \3 \4 => unused => not using \3 \4 and I had an old note about them causing issues so I replaced with "unused" so the other args stay in the same position
