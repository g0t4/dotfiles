#
#
# NOTES - reproducible installs on other accounts/machines:
#   - i.e. iterm2env python stuffs
#   - btw can launch with this:
#       ~/Applications/iTerm.app/Contents/Resources/it2run (pwd)/wes/
#       https://iterm2.com/python-api/tutorial/running.html
#

# ****** pypi deps
#    have to setup as iterm2 script with full env... not sure yet how to mirror this across machines... figure that out later
#    FYI Scripts => Manage => Manage Dependencies => pick script => Add button => sometimes this fails, if so run the command it shows (pip install) at the command line and it will work
#    /Users/wes/.config/iterm2/AppSupport/Scripts/ask-openai/streaming-ask-openai/iterm2env/versions/3.10.4/bin/pip3 list    # list packages for "basic env" iterm2 scripts (not full env)
#    /Users/wes/.config/iterm2/AppSupport/Scripts/ask-openai/streaming-ask-openai/iterm2env/versions/3.10.4/bin/pip3 install openai    # FYI may not show up in list that iterm2 shows but doesn't matter, as long as its installed it should work fine
#       BTW: ls -al /Users/wes/.config/iterm2/AppSupport -> /Users/wes/Library/Application Support/iTerm2
#    FYI ignored iterm2env dir... might have to copy that between machines at first? who knows... learn how iterm2 sets up these envs and see if I cannot find a reproducible way?
#    FYI I have a symlink from ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts -> /Users/wes/repos/wes-config/wes-bootstrap/subs/dotfiles/iterm2/scripts
#       so make sure this is setup on other machines/accounts too
#

# IDEAS:
#   - implement functions to allow tools to be used to gather further info about the environment, i.e. run a tool to find what package managers are installed and report back so the right package install command is generated, just an idea, only consider this if I have a problem w/o tools

# alt invocation triggers:
#        @iterm2.ContextMenuProviderRPC can add to context menu, is there a way to add to regular menus?! could then bypass keystroke monitor for some actions (above)

#
# *** If youâ€™d like your script to launch automatically when iTerm2 starts, move it to $HOME/Library/ApplicationSupport/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch.

# *** iterm variables
#   BTW variables => Console => INSPECTOR => Variables tab => shows values per tab (move between tabs to refresh)
#   other vars of interest: path

# *** prompt notes
#   prompt https://iterm2.com/python-api/prompt.html#iterm2.Prompt
#   prompts = await iterm2.prompt.async_list_prompts(connection, session.session_id)

# *** send key combos to the shell as if typed (using ascii codes => unicode escaped (hex))
#   unicode_escape (ascii codes) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
#   await session.async_send_text("\x03") # ctrl+c # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII => \x03 (hex) => ETX => Ctrl+C
#   await session.async_send_text("\x1bk")  # esc+k => (must be lowercase k) => custom keybinding in my shells to yank (copy) + kill (clear)
#   PRN restore clipboard after done copying current command?
#     For now, leave in clipboard so it can be pasted
#     (b/c chunk responses mean ctrl+z undo is hassle unlike a single final response in single.py)
# *** clipboard to get command
#   clipboard_content = pyperclip.paste()

# *** PRN set user variables in shell that are readable in iterm2 via this python API
#   FYI I can communicate "user" defined variables (from shell into iTerm2 variables under "user") via iterm2_print_user_vars => define it as a func, have it call `iterm2_set_user_var foo bar` and then its called every time it communicates other vars (RemoteHost and CurrentDir vars) => then async_get_variable("user.foo") to get value in here! this appears to be called before/after every command (or prompt IIUC) => https://iterm2.com/documentation-scripting-fundamentals.html#setting-user-defined-variables
#    PRN could call this on every keystroke to not need to yank command line... though yanking works fine!
#
#
# *** get screen contents => literally can get text from the entire screen (line by line)
#   what = await session.async_get_screen_contents()  # gets screen contents, now, can I deliniate current command line position from this? that would work then to show me the command!
#   cursor = what.cursor_coord
#   cursor_line = cursor.y
#   print(what.line(cursor_line).string)  # works to get line with cursor!
#
#   FYI I could write the prompt to a file too, i.e. for windows t
#
#   await iterm2.MainMenu.async_select_menu_item(connection, "About iTerm2")
#   await iterm2.MainMenu.async_select_menu_item(connection, "Select Current Command")  # w0000t
