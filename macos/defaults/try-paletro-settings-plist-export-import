a subset is fine and maybe desired:
    skipWelcome = 1;
    theme = "Extra Dark";
    usePreferenceShortcut = 1;

also:
    SUEnableAutomaticChecks = 0;
    SUHasLaunchedBefore = 1;
    listNumber = 9;
    "palette_rule_app" =     (
                (
            "com.microsoft.VSCode",
            disabled,
            "VS Code"
        ),
                (
            "com.sublimetext.2",
            disabled,
            "Sublime Text"
        ),
                (
            "com.github.atom",
            disabled,
            Atom
        ),
                (
            "com.apple.dt.Xcode",
            allow,
            XCode
        ),
                (
            "com.apple.finder",
            allow,
            Finder
        ),
                (
            "dev.zed.Zed-Preview",
            disabled,
            "Zed Preview"
        ),
                (
            "dev.zed.Zed",
            disabled,
            Zed
        )
    );

would likely need more than just this setting to get login to work, so bypass is fine for now
    startOnLogin = 1;

ideally a separate plist that I can import and merge into current config (not replace, but overwrite specified keys).. plistbuddy can do it and I have examples of that...
   also long ago with my ansible-osx defaults config I could import a plist file IIRC and it overwrote (not replaced)... so check there too
