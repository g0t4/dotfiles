## FYI

bat $HOME/.ask.openai.log

## MEDIUM

- where is the icon file (i.e. icns, or other image format) for the ~/Movies directory
	find /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources -type f -name "*.icns"
- install foo
	does it suggest os specific package manager and valid package?

## EASY 

- run nginx in docker
- list huge files
- apt install for netutils on ubunttu
