  # eq(n,0) grabs the first frame b/c it won't be treated as a scene change
  # gte(scene,0.2) grabs all frames with a scene change greater than 20% probability
    # seems like 5% is needed on terminal demos just to get about any scene detection - maybe my transitions are too smooth to notice beyond change window from terminal to browser or back and that might be it
      # tried 1% - works much better!
  # drawtext adds timecode of frame in original video
  # vsync vfr changes to variable frame rate otherwise original frame rate is kept with the original pts's so basically selected frames just replace all frames after them and we export hundreds of unneeded copies of these scene change frames
  # output file with original clip at start and then incrementing counter - I wish this could be timecode (pts) so I didn't have to draw that on image but oh well it can't be at this time
