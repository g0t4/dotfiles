# this is a set of changes that would not be wise to
# start out with in the course series, because
# these alter basic functionality in a way that would differ
# materially versus the viewers experience with an
# stock shell configuration
# i.e. aliasing ls to lsd

# to avoid forgetting about this I will stick with abbrs
# so its obviuos that I left this enabled, but I should
# disable this at the start of the series... nothing
# wrong with introducing these as I go, especially in later
# advanced courses
abbr ls lsd
