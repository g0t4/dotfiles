# Vim Mnemonics

*Note, I prefer either a single word (i.e. `y`ank) or a short phrase that rhymes*


- `A`ppend at the End
    - `I`nsert at the Start
    - `a` is for after, so `i` is before - the current cursor (in normal mode)
- [`J`oin (lines)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x9jRt53ZYA)
- `d`elete
- `c`hange (change implies insert mode)
    - `s` substitute (== `cl`)
- `r`eplace
- `y`ank
- `t`ill / un`t`il
- `f`ind
- `^`/`$` start/end of line - as in a regex
- move/select
    - `b`ack a word
    - `w`ord / for`w`ard
    - `e`nd of word
    - text-objects
        - `i`nner / `a`aroud
        - `iw` inner word
        - `it` inside tag
        - `as` around `s`entence
        - `ip` inner `p`aragraph
        - `a(` around block
        - `i(` inside block
- `%` - percenthesis (parenthesis)
- `>>` - shift right
    - `<<` - shift left
- commands
    - `:!{shell_cmd}` (much like a shebang!)
    - `:r`ead
    - `:w`rite
    - `:wq` write and quit
    - `:q` quit
    - `:q!` quit without saving
    - `:e` edit
    - `:h` help

## WIP

- `/` and `?` search forward/backward (I bet many don't know it, or at least not `?`)
    - `n`ext and `N` (shift+n == opposite of `n`ext)
- `.` - repeat last command (can show next to `<<`?)
- `:h object-motions` - move by:
    - `{`/`}` - paragraphs (think blank line separators)
    - `(`/`)` - sentences (ends w/ `.` then space/new line)
    - `[[`/`]]` - sections (i.e. markdown headers, or start of func)
        - `[]`/`][` - end of func
    - sentence
- insert `o`ne line below, `O`ne above?
    - `p`aste below, `P`aste above
- `g`oto (in many cases, but not all)
    - `gg` - start of file
    - `G` - end of file
- `0` start of non-blank chars (FYI end blanks not common so no equivalent)
- group related operations?
    - dont really wanna turn this inot list of all commands, or would that be useful and color code memonics?
    - `c`hange (`cc` = change line, `C` = change to end of line)
        - (delete-insert replacement) ==> delete, then go to insert mode
            - `cw` == `dwi`
        - `s` substitute (== `cl`)
        - `S` substitute line (== `cc`)
        - `r`eplace
            - `R` replace line
    - `d`elete (`dd` = delete line, `D` = delete to end of line)
    - OR, keep them separate?
- Line level (capitalized)
    - cursor movement
        - `H`ighest line (top)
        - `M`iddle line
        - `L`owest line (bottom)
        - `zz` (middle)
        - `zt` top
        - `zb` bottom
    - entire line
        - `cc` change line
        - `dd` delete line
        - `yy` yank line
    - To the End of the line:
        - `C`hange
        - `D`elete
        - `Y`ank
    - `I`/`A` at the start/end of line
    - `J`oin lines
- `xp`ose => `transpose`
- surrounding (i.e. nvim-surround, et al)
    - `cs"_` [c]hange [s]urrounding `"` to `_`
    - `ds"` [d]elete [s]urrounding `_`
    - `ys{motion}"` [y]ou [s]urround (I hate this purported mnemonic, it's not at all memorable) - `y`oke? (as in attach a cross bar with ends that attach to cattle?) need smth new... or maybe this one is just gonna have to be its c/d/y and c/d have good mnemonics, so y is left over?
        - `ysl_` - surround one character with `_`
- command help
    - `:h c` -  can lookup any char and get its help page
        - `:h g` - cmds prefixed with `g`
    - `:h index` - index of builtin keymaps (not user defined)
    - `:h c_` - cmap builtins
    - `:h down` - wilder/nvim-cmp cmdline completions can be fuzzy filtered (FYI lowercase matches case insensitivee, uppercase letter only match uppercase - in most fuzzy match algos)
- modes
    - commands for managing user-defined key`map`s  (TODO prune to critical only, i.e. probaly `x`map/`v`map are probably the only commonly used that aren't obvious
        - `i`map (insert)
        - `n`map (normal)
        - `c`map (cmdline)
        - `s`map (select)
        - `x`map (visual) *** need mnemonic here (maybe smth about how this is like `v`map but just for visual, like X out select? = nah)
        - `o`map (operator-pending)
        - `t`map (terminal)
        - multiple modes:
            - `map` = normal,visual,select,operator-pending
            - `v`map = visual,select
            - map`!` = insert,cmdline
            - `l`map = insert,cmdline,lang-arg
    - `i`nsert
    - `n`ormal
    - `c`mdline
    - `v`isual
    - `s`elect
    - `t`erminal
    - `:h vim-modes`
