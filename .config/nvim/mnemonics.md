# Vim Mnemonics

*Note, I prefer either a single word (i.e. `y`ank) or a short phrase that rhymes*


- `A`ppend at the End
- `I`nsert at the Start
- [`J`oin (lines)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x9jRt53ZYA)
- `c`hange
- `d`elete
- `y`ank
- `t`ill / un`t`il
- `f`ind
- move/select
  - `b`ack a word
  - `w`ord / for`w`ard
  - `e`nd of word
  - `i`nner / `a`aroud
- `%` - percenthesis (parenthesis)

## WIP

- Line level (capitalized)
  - cursor movement
    - `H`ighest line (top)
    - `M`iddle line
    - `L`owest line (bottom)
    - `zz` (middle)
    - `zt` top
    - `zb` bottom
  - To the End of the line:
    - `C`hange
    - `D`elete
    - `Y`ank
  - `I`/`A` at the start/end of line
  - `J`oin lines
- `xp`ose => `transpose`
- surrounding (i.e. nvim-surround, et al)
  - `cs"` [c]hange [s]urrounding to _
  - `ds"` [d]elete [s]urrounding _
  - `ys{motion}"` [y]ou [s]urround (I hate this purported mnemonic, it's not at all memorable) - `y`oke? (as in attach a cross bar with ends that attach to cattle?) need smth new... or maybe this one is just gonna have to be its c/d/y and c/d have good mnemonics, so y is left over?
