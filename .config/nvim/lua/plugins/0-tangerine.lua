--   fennel-language-server
--     apparently? doesn't support vim APIs (yet?)
--     cargo install --git https://github.com/rydesun/fennel-language-server
--     s/b fast, right? native binary?
--   https://git.sr.ht/~xerool/fennel-ls
--     does this support vim APIs?
--     pure fennel, suggests to me gonna be slow? or does it compile to a binary?
