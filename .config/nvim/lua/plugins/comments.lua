-- TODO move comments related settings/plugins here

-- TODO try plugins that help autoformat in comments
-- - i.e. that autoformat a list like this
-- - and will then setup matching next line
-- - and reformat/reindent existing lists? (consistency would rock)
--  - I am very inconsistent about my lists in comments
--


-- SEPARATE:
-- - highlights of comments (move here?)
-- - check out how vim-notes impls highlights of comments, just curious: https://peterodding.com/code/vim/notes#customizing_syntax_highlighting_of_notes
--     - I don't think this is for comments but I wanna see how it approaches notes highlighting that is similar to what I am doing w/ comments
