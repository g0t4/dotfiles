-- FYI it doesn't seem like the API for hs and its extensions were built with any sort of discoverability in mind, the LS can't find most everything (even if I add the path to the extensions to the coc config... so just forget about using that)... i.e. look at require("hs.console") and go to the module and it has like 2 things and no wonder the LS doesn't find anything... it's all globals built on hs.* which is gah
-- TLDR => hs.* was not built for LS to work, you just have to know what to use (or look at docs)
-- JUST PUT hs global into lua LS config and be done with that

-- config console:
-- https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.console.html
hs.console.darkMode(true)

-- ensure IPC so `hs` cli works
--     hs -c 'hs.console.clearConsole()'
--     hs -c 'hs.alert.show("Hello, Stream Deck!")'
hs.ipc.cli = true

local streamStdout = require("config.tests.stream-stdout").streamStdout
hs.hotkey.bind({ "cmd", "alt", "ctrl" }, "S", streamStdout)

AskOpenAIStreaming = require("config.ask.ask").AskOpenAIStreaming

-- test w/ T
hs.hotkey.bind({ "cmd", "alt", "ctrl" }, "T", function()
    local result = require("config.ask.selection").getSelectedText()
    print("result:\n ", result)
end)
