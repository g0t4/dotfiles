# modify delay to consider if esc key a seq or standalone
set fish_escape_delay_ms 200 # 30ms is default and way too fast (ie esc+k is almost impossible to trigger)

# PRN add a binding to clear screen + reset status of last run command
#    OR modify prompt (type fish_prompt) as it already distinguishes (with bold) if status was carried over from previous command so perhaps I could find a way to hijack that ? 
#    OR hide status in the prompt (perhaps like zsh I could show non-zero exit code on last line before new prompt?)


### FISH HELP ###
set __fish_help_dir "" # overwrite fish help dir thus forcing the use of https://fishshell.com instead of local files (which I prefer b/c I have highlighting of fishshell.com pages) # ... try it with: `help help` => opens https://fishshell.com/docs/3.6/interactive.html#help
# see `type help` to find the part of the help command that decides what to open 

### BINDINGS ###
# some of these might be a result of setting up iTerm2 to use xterm default keymapping (in profile), might need to adjust if key map is subsequently changed
bind -k sdc kill-word # shift+del to kill forward a word (otherwise its esc+d only), I have a habit of using this (not sure why, probably an old keymapping in zsh or?)
