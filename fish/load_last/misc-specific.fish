### FISH HELP ###
set __fish_help_dir "" # overwrite fish help dir thus forcing the use of https://fishshell.com instead of local files (which I prefer b/c I have highlighting of fishshell.com pages) # ... try it with: `help help` => opens https://fishshell.com/docs/3.6/interactive.html#help
# see `type help` to find the part of the help command that decides what to open
